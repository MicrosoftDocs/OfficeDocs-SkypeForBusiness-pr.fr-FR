The first step in creating a more secure unified communications system was to design threat models and test each feature as it was designed. Multiple security-related improvements were built into the coding process and practices. Build-time tools detect buffer overruns and other potential security threats before the code is checked in to the final product. Of course, it is impossible to design against all unknown security threats. No system can guarantee complete security.

### <a name="eavesdropping"></a><span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-134">Protection contre l’écoute</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-134">Eavesdropping</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p107">Une attaque par écoute peut se produire lorsqu’une personne malveillante parvient à accéder au chemin d’accès des données d’un réseau et qu’elle peut ainsi surveiller et lire le trafic. Cette attaque est également appelée reniflage (« sniffing ») ou surveillance (« snooping »). Si le trafic consiste en du texte simple, l’intrus peut lire le trafic lorsqu’il accède au chemin d’accès des données. Par exemple, une attaque peut être lancée en contrôlant un routeur sur le chemin de données.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic. This is also called sniffing or snooping. If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked. TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. This does not prevent eavesdropping, but the attacker cannot read the traffic unless the encryption is broken.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p109">The TURN protocol is used for real time media purposes.  The TURN protocol does not mandate the traffic to be encrypted and the information that it is sending is protected by message integrity. Although it is open to eavesdropping, the information it is sending (that is, IP addresses and port) can be extracted directly by simply looking at the source and destination addresses of the packets. The SfBO service ensures that the data is valid by checking the Message Integrity of the message using the key derived from a few items including a TURN password, which is never sent in clear text. SRTP is used for media traffic and is also encrypted.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p109">The TURN protocol is used for real time media purposes.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so. A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is the entity normally identified by the IP address. Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. Using TLS prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoofing on a specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that SfBO uses. However, because authentication in SfBO is performed with certificates, an attacker would not have a valid certificate required to spoof one of the parties in the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an attacker can modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server as a trusted server or modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect through the attacker on their way to the server.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes. SfBO uses SRTP in conjunction with a secure signaling protocol that protects transmissions from replay attacks by enabling the receiver to maintain an index of already received RTP packets and compare each new packet with those already listed in the index.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p114">Le spim correspond à des messages instantanés commerciaux ou des demandes d’abonnement aux informations de présence non sollicités. S’il ne constitue pas à lui seul une menace envers le réseau, il peut néanmoins perturber les activités des utilisateurs et avoir un impact négatif sur la disponibilité des ressources et la production. Il représente donc un risque potentiel pour le réseau. Prenons le cas d’utilisateurs qui génèrent du spim en s’envoyant mutuellement des demandes. Un utilisateur peut en bloquer un autre pour ne plus recevoir de messages instantanés indésirables. Toutefois, dans le cas de la fédération, il peut s’avérer difficile de faire face à une attaque de spim coordonnée, à moins de désactiver la fédération pour le partenaire.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p114">Spim is unsolicited commercial instant messages or presence subscription requests. While not by itself a compromise of the network, it is annoying in the least, can reduce resource availability and production, and can possibly lead to a compromise of the network. An example of this is users spimming each other by sending requests. Users can block each other to prevent this, but with federation, if a coordinated spim attack is established, this can be difficult to overcome unless you disable federation for the partner.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p115">A virus is a unit of code whose purpose is to reproduce additional, similar code units. To work, a virus needs a host, such as a file, email, or program. Like a virus, a worm is a unit of code that is coded to reproduce additional, similar code units, but that unlike a virus does not need a host. Viruses and worms primarily show up during file transfers between clients or when URLs are sent from other users. If a virus is on your computer, it can, for example, use your identity and send instant messages on your behalf.  Standard client security best practices such as periodically scanning for viruses can mitigate this issue.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p115">A virus is a unit of code whose purpose is to reproduce additional, similar code units.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p126">TLS and MTLS protocols provide encrypted communications and endpoint authentication on the Internet.

<span data-ttu-id="5a1e0-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect. On a TLS connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the client and the DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt the symmetric encryption keys to be used for the communication, so only the original owner of the certificate can use its private key to decrypt the contents of the communication. The resulting connection is trusted and from that point is not challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-based.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="5a1e0-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect.

Because the A/V Edge service is the sole process using these ports, the size of the port range does not indicate the potential surface of attack. Good security practice is to always minimize the total number of listening ports by not running unnecessary network services. If a network service is not running, it is not exploitable by a remote attacker and the surface of attack of the host computer is reduced. However, within a single service, reducing the number of ports does not provide the same benefit. The A/V Edge service software is no more exposed to attack with 10,000 ports open as it is with 10.
